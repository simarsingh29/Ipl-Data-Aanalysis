# Ipl-Data-Aanalysis
📌 Project Overview

The IPL Cricket Analytics & Prediction Dashboard is a data-driven interactive tool built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning.
It provides in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling for IPL seasons from 2008 to 2024, with powerful visualizations and predictive insights.

📊 Analysis Features
🔹 Toss Analysis

What it does: Analyzes the decision trends of toss-winning captains (batting or fielding first).

Why it matters: Toss often influences match results, especially in specific venues.

Insights Provided:

% of times teams chose batting vs fielding.

Win percentage correlation with toss outcomes.

Venue-based toss impact (e.g., chasing advantage in Mumbai).

🔹 Win Analysis

What it does: Studies how teams perform across seasons, venues, and home vs away conditions.

Why it matters: Helps identify dominant venues and consistently strong teams.

Insights Provided:

Win ratio of each team per season.

Which venues favor batting/fielding.

Home vs away team performance comparison.

🔹 Score Predictions (Machine Learning)

What it does: Predicts first-innings score using ML models (Random Forest).

Why it matters: Score prediction helps understand target-setting strategies.

Insights Provided:

Predicted range of final score (e.g., 160–175).

Key factors: overs played, wickets lost, run rate, batting team.

Can be used in live match simulations.

🔹 Player Analysis

What it does: Identifies top-performing players across IPL history.

Why it matters: Player evaluation is crucial for auction decisions and fantasy cricket insights.

Insights Provided:

Top Run Scorers: Batsmen with highest runs across seasons.

Top Wicket Takers: Bowlers dominating across years.

Strike Rate vs Economy Graphs: Balanced performance check.

Consistency metrics: Which players perform season after season.

🔹 Team Titles & Dominance

What it does: Tracks which teams won the most IPL trophies.

Why it matters: Identifies historical dominance and team performance consistency.

Insights Provided:

Total IPL titles per franchise.

Year-wise champions trendline.

Longest winning streaks and most consistent franchises.

🔹 Batting vs Bowling Analysis (Head-to-Head)

What it does: Provides batsman vs bowler matchups for all seasons.

Why it matters: Helps evaluate player strengths & weaknesses.

Insights Provided:

Runs scored by batsman against specific bowlers.

Dismissals caused by particular bowlers.

Head-to-head win/loss between batsman and bowler.

Example: “Virat Kohli vs Lasith Malinga” → runs scored, dismissals, strike rate.
