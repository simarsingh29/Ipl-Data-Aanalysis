## 📂 Dataset
This project uses the [Dataset and Cleaned Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simardeepsinghbhatia/ipl-data-analysis-dataset?select=Dataset).  

⚠️ Due to its large size (215 GB), the dataset is **not stored in this repository**.  
Please download it from Kaggle to run the analysis.

📊 Dashboard Features – Detailed Briefing
🔹 Toss Analysis 🎲

Toss plays a crucial role in the outcome of many IPL matches, and this section captures those insights.

Tracks toss decision trends – whether teams prefer batting or fielding first.

Provides venue-specific insights, since some stadiums favor chasing while others suit defending.

Evaluates the relationship between toss and match result – Does winning the toss really increase the chances of winning the match?

🔹 Win Analysis 🏆

Understanding how teams win across seasons helps identify dominant franchises and their strategies.

Shows team winning percentages both overall and broken down season-wise.

Compares home vs away performances, highlighting teams with strong home advantage.

Identifies the most dominant teams in IPL history, giving fans and analysts a clear view of consistent winners.

🔹 Score Predictions 🎯

Target-setting is one of the most critical strategies in T20 cricket. This dashboard uses machine learning to predict first-innings scores.

Prediction model inputs: overs completed, wickets lost, run rate, and team details.

Helps in forecasting first-innings totals and evaluating if teams are on track for a competitive score.

Provides strategic insights into whether batting teams are setting challenging targets.

🔹 Player Analysis 👨‍💻

Star players often define the success of their franchises. This section breaks down batting and bowling performances.

Top batsmen stats – runs scored, strike rates, boundary percentages.

Top bowlers stats – wickets taken, economy rates, match-winning spells.

Includes consistency metrics to highlight players who deliver across multiple seasons rather than just one-off performances.

🔹 Team Titles & Dominance 🏅

Titles and consistency are what separate good teams from great ones. This feature showcases the long-term dominance of franchises.

Displays the number of trophies each team has won.

Provides a year-wise champions timeline, giving a historic view of IPL winners.

Highlights the most consistent franchises, based on playoff appearances and sustained performance.

🔹 Batting vs Bowling Analysis ⚔️

One of the most exciting aspects of cricket is the battle between bat and ball. This feature digs into head-to-head player matchups.

Batsman vs bowler duels – runs scored, dismissals, and strike rates in specific matchups.

Helps uncover who dominates whom in iconic rivalries.

Example: Kohli vs Bumrah → total runs, number of times dismissed, and strike rate against the bowler.
